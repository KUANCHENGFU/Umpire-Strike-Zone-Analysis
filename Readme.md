# Umpire Strike Zone Analysis

## Overview
This project aimed at assisting the CTBC Brothers' coaching team in improving batters’ plate discipline and formulating batterymates’ pitching strategies by approximating each umpire's strike zone shape. The CTBC Brothers are a professional baseball team in Taiwan. This project is basically composed of two parts as follows:
1. Employ a generalized additive model to estimate the probability of pitches being called strikes at different
locations and further approximate the umpire's strike zone shape before each game
2. Calculate the umpire’s accuracy of ball-strike calls based on the approximated strike zone shape after each game
